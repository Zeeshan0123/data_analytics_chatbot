---------------------------- guide for virtual environment --------------------

first create a conda virtual environment that is saved in D:\Anaconda\envs  lets suppose test is the new environment

add these two paths to PC environment viriables
D:\Anaconda
D:\Anaconda\Scripts

some times in vs code conda is not activated due to sme issues then write this command to activate your Anaconda on vs code terminal D:\Anaconda\Scripts\activate 
after that you will this (base) is the start of your terminal
Now your all anaconda commands are working properly like conda create etc

After creating a virtual environment in  D:\Anaconda\envs for example test  still then test environment is not showing in vs code now you have to add a new path in your
PC environment
 
if you want to use it in vs_code then add their path in  PC environment like D:\Anaconda\envs\test\Scripts

-------------------------------  very very important point --------------------------

In vs_code always use command prompt because instead of powershell ok always remember because in powershell all commands are giving you error
